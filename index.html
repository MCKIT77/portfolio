                <p class="text"> Hi, I'm Jacob McKitrick! I'm a Web Developer based in Pittsburgh, PA. I'm passionate
                    about blockchain, and I relly enjoy solving a difficult problem with code.

                    With 1 year of experience in Web Development, I've had the opportunity to build a few games with
                    javascript and started some websites but unable to finish without knowing the backend. Which is why
                    i am taking a web development bootcamp! These experiences have helped me develop a unique
                    perspective on web debelopment, which I bring to every project or task I work on.

                    When I'm not working, I enjoy Golfing, Fishing, Camping, and spending time with my pup. I'm also an
                    avid gamer, and love to learn new things.

                    If you're interested in learning more about me, or would like to discuss a potential project or
                    collaboration, please don't hesitate to email me using the contact form below. I'd love to hear from
                    you!
                </p>
